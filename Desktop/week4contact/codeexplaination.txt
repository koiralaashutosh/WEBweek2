We have built a simple Contacts API using Express and TypeScript. An Express server is set up with JSON parsing enabled so the API can receive and send data in JSON format. Contact data is stored in an in-memory array defined in contacts.ts, where each contact contains an ID, name, phone number, and email address. To keep the code organized, separate files are created for each operation, such as retrieving all contacts, retrieving a single contact by ID, adding a new contact, updating an existing contact, and deleting a contact.

Each API route is connected to its own handler function, which performs validation and updates the contacts array accordingly. When adding or updating a contact, the API validates required fields such as name and phone number, and ensures the email format is correct if provided. For update and delete operations, the API first checks whether the contact exists before making changes. All routes are registered in the main index.ts file, which starts the server and exposes the endpoints so they can be tested using Postman.

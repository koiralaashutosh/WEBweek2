In the Expense Tracker project, we will use the same REST API concepts learned from the Contacts API by implementing different HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE using Express and TypeScript. GET requests will be used to fetch user data, income records, expense records, and dashboard summary information. POST requests will be used to create new resources, such as user accounts, login sessions, and new income or expense entries. Each API will receive data from the frontend, validate the input, and store it securely in the database.

The PUT and PATCH methods will be used to update existing income or expense records, where PUT will replace the full record and PATCH will update only specific fields. The DELETE method will be used to remove income or expense entries when the user chooses to delete them. Unlike the Contacts API where data is stored in memory, the Expense Tracker will use MongoDB to store data permanently, and JWT authentication will be applied to protect all API routes. All endpoints will be connected to the main server file, allowing the React frontend to communicate with the backend and display updated information through lists, charts, and dashboard components.
